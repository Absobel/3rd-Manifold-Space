Little game made in C using OpenGL. It's actually just an excuse to learn OpenGL but whatever.

## How to build

```make```

That's it. (Well you need to have the glfw library installed, but that's it.)
You'll find your executable in the `target` folder.

You can even run it at the same time with :

```make run```
